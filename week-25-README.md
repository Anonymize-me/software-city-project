# Week 25

Over the course of the past week I have refactored the source code quite intensively. Furtherore I have implemented all of the required features from last week. After this weeks meeting I have started to implement the new formulated features and worked therefore on the following parts:
* [x] 2 slider thumbs: slider-thumb-t0, slider-thumb-t1
* [x] lay a div behind both slider thumbs
* [x] don't let t0 go further right than t1
* [x] don't let t1 go further left than t0
* [ ] if moving the div, move both t0 and t1 in this fixed distance between each other
* [x] show a dropdown for aggregating functions
* [x] implemenet 3 aggregating functions: none, sum, integral curve
* [x] no matter what is selected, always calculate based on t0 and t1 thumbs
* [x] change the timestamp format to be based on milliseconds or a number, or whatever
* [x] adjust the positioning and default location of the info frame and the model tree frame in a meaningful way
* [x] added arrow indicator ontop of the clicked object in the visualization
* [x] 2 additional chart graphs in the info frame. One for all data for the height metaphor, one for all data for the color metaphor
