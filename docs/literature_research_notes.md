## Calculating static software metrics

Looking for papers that write about how they calculate static software metrics.

Looking for ways how to calculate static software metrics. [This page](https://github.com/analysis-tools-dev/static-analysis) and [this page](https://owasp.org/www-community/Source_Code_Analysis_Tools) provide a nice overview over static code analysis tools. Unfortunately those tools don't quite achieve what we need. The most prevalent use case for those analysis tools is to identify code smells or security flaws. We instead, are interested in just simple source code metrics.
* Do it myself
* SonarQube

* https://git-quick-stats.sh/: something like this tool would be nice, where we can access a github repository an get simple statistics on each individual commit.
