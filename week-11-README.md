# Week 11
This week I have worked on the following features:
* I refactored the creation of the buildings
and the grouping logic into an JavaSourceCodeDataObject.js
file.
* I created another DataObject-file for the use-case of BPMN's:
  * BPMNDataObject.js: This file specifies another way
  to parse data provided by the user. In this case a BPMN-model.
  Now I am able to also visualize BPMN-model data.
* Dynamic matching of metaphor attributes and data attributes
